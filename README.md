Auto-close Zoom, Slack, and Figma tabs.

Know of another service to add? Please send comments or PRs!

### Figma Notice

This extension is meant for use with the Figma desktop app and will prevent you from opening Figma projects in the browser (since the tab will be auto-closed). You can still open projects in the browser by going to [figma.com](https://figma.com) and choosing a project on the home screen.
